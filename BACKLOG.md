# Backlog — xqlite (review program)

Confirmed-but-not-blocking items + tracked S3s. Severity per the
ratified bar in `REVIEW_AXES.md`. Nothing here is ever silently
dropped; S3s get a committed closer-look pass after the S0–S2
burn-down.

## Open

- [S3] `cargo test` runs only in the Linux lint job — Rust unit
  tests never execute on macOS/Windows. Add lanes or justify.
  (wave-1 recon)
- [S3] Elixir floor: mix.exs claims `~> 1.15`, CI floor is 1.17.
  Add 1.15/1.16 lanes or raise the floor — floor-raise is a Dimi
  values call. Mirrors an identical gap in xqlite_ecto3. (wave-1)
- [probe] Docs-build telemetry-flag state: confirm what config
  hexdocs was built under for 0.9.0 (macro docs were flag-dependent
  until `51d1a17`; fix ships with the next release). (wave-1)
- [probe] Bundled-SQLite-in-artifact check: strings/symbol scan of
  each precompiled tarball proving SQLite 3.53.2 is statically in
  (feature-unification failure class). Cheap mechanical gate before
  the announcement. (wave-1)
- [S3] FTS5 guide is linear-executable — wire it up as an executed
  test so the guide can't rot. (A11 seed)
- [S3] M6 (Run 1): wal/progress/busy C callbacks are raw-FFI-registered
  with NO `catch_unwind` (unlike rusqlite's guarded trampolines) —
  panic-free today only by construction. Add our own unwind guard so a
  future edit can't turn a callback panic into VM death.
- [S3] M7 (Run 1): `busy_callback` `thread::sleep` + `wal_hook_callback`
  checkpoint I/O run on the C stack holding the conn Mutex. By-design
  (busy retry / autocheckpoint emulation) but owes a docs/scheduler
  note so users know a busy-sleep policy pins the connection.
- [S3] M10/M11 (Run 1): `explain_analyze.rs:380-490` (`map_put().unwrap()`
  ×24) and `nif.rs:2057` (`OwnedBinary::new(0).unwrap()`) use `unwrap`
  where the crate's graceful `map_err`/`ok_or_else` convention applies.
  Latent-only; consistency fix.
- [probe] M5 sub-issue (Run 1): `enif_send(NULL,…)` from a NORMAL
  scheduler (session_changeset/patchset path) vs the repo's dirty-only
  note — the busy_handler comment claims "any thread (OTP 26.1+)".
  Reconcile the comments and confirm against an assertion-enabled ERTS.
